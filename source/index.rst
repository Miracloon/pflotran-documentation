The current version of PFLOTRAN is 5.0 and was released **November 01, 2023**.
You may find the most up-to-date documentation for the development version of
PFLOTRAN at
`documentation.pflotran.org <https://documentation.pflotran.org>`_

PFLOTRAN is an open source, state-of-the-art massively parallel subsurface flow 
and reactive transport code. The code is developed under a GNU LGPL license 
allowing for third parties to interface proprietary software with the code, 
however any modifications to the code itself must be documented and remain open 
source. PFLOTRAN is written in object oriented, free formatted Fortran 2003. 
The choice of Fortran over C/C++ was based primarily on the need to enlist and 
preserve tight collaboration with experienced domain scientists, without which 
PFLOTRAN's sophisticated process models would not exist. PFLOTRAN's source code repository is on Bitbucket_.
