.. _strata-card:

STRATA
======
Couples material ids and/or properties with a region in the problem domain. 

Required Cards:
---------------
STRATA
 Opens the strata block.

**Option 1**

FILE <string>
 Name of an HDF5 file from which material IDs are read for each cell in the entire domain.

**Option 2**

MATERIAL <string>
 Name of the material property to be associated with a region.  

and

:ref:`region-card` <string>
 Name of region to be associated with a material property.

**Option 3**

MATERIAL <string>

SURFACE_DATASET <string>
 Name of a 2D gridded :ref:`dataset-card` in XY defining the top or bottom 
 surface of a geologic layer.

and

SET_MATERIAL_IDS_BELOW_SURFACE or SET_MATERIAL_IDS_ABOVE_SURFACE
 Flag dictating whether cells are to be set to the MATERIAL type 
 below or above the SURFACE_DATASET.

Optional Cards:
---------------
START_TIME <float> <string>
  Start time when STRATA card is relevant, where <string> indicates the units of
  time. This card is useful for changing a material property at a given point in 
  time (e.g. due to human intrusion). 

END_TIME <float> <string>
  End time when STRATA card is relevant, where <string> indicates the units of
  time.

INACTIVE
  Inactivates all cells in the associated REGION.

REALIZATION_DEPENDENT
  Specifies that material IDs listed in the material ID file are realization 
  dependent.

Examples
--------
**Assign material properties by region:**

 ::

  STRATA
    MATERIAL hanford_unit
    REGION source_zone
  /

**Assign material properties through material ids read from an HDF5 formatted file.**  No need for a region here as material ids are assigned to the entire grid on a cell by cell basis.

 ::

  STRATA
    FILE ./543_material_ids.h5
  /

**Assign material properties using surface datasets and superposition.**
Since SET_MATERIAL_IDS_BELOW_SURFACE is defined, strata overwrite 
all cell IDs below their surface. 
Therefore, all cells are initially inactivated (i.e., the INACTIVE 
card inactivates the cells regardless of which soil is assigned). 
Then, soil1 is assigned to all cells below layer1_dataset,
soil2 is assigned to all cells below layer1_dataset, and soil3 to all
cells below layer3_dataset. In the end, the IDs of cells below
layer3_dataset are set or overwritten 4 times. *Note that you can 
restrict the assignment of IDs below a surface to select zones below 
that region by including a REGION card.*

 ::

  STRATA ! this block inactivates cells above the land surface (defined by layer1_dataset)
    INACTIVE
    MATERIAL soil1
    REGION all
  END
  
  STRATA ! all cells below layer1_dataset surface are assigned soil1
    MATERIAL soil1
    SURFACE_DATASET layer1_dataset
    SET_MATERIAL_IDS_BELOW_SURFACE
  END
  
  STRATA ! all cells below layer1_dataset surface are assigned soil2
    MATERIAL soil2
    SURFACE_DATASET layer2_dataset
    SET_MATERIAL_IDS_BELOW_SURFACE
  END
  
  STRATA ! all cells below layer1_dataset surface are assigned soil3
    MATERIAL soil3
    SURFACE_DATASET layer3_dataset
    SET_MATERIAL_IDS_BELOW_SURFACE
  END

**Assigning evolving strata:**

 ::

  MATERIAL_PROPERTY soil1
    ID 1
    ...
    PERMEABILITY
      PERM_ISO 1.d-12
    /
    ...
  END

  MATERIAL_PROPERTY soil2
    ID 2
    ...
    PERMEABILITY
      PERM_ISO 5.d-13
    /
    ...
  END

  STRATA
    REGION all
    MATERIAL soil1
    START_TIME 0.d0 y
    FINAL_TIME 25.d0 y
  END

  STRATA
    REGION all
    MATERIAL soil2
    START_TIME 25.d0 y
    FINAL_TIME 50.d0 y
  END

Example HDF5 file with material ids
...................................
The HDF5 file must have two datasets named **Cell Ids** and **Material Ids** 
within a group named **Materials**.  Use this 
:download:`python script <files/material_id_loader.py>` and associated 
:download:`data file <files/543_material_ids.txt>` as an example of how to load 
material ids into 543_material_ids.h5 (above).
To use this script, you must install compatible versions of the **h5py** and 
**numpy** python libraries.
