CHARACTERISTIC_CURVES
=====================
Specifies the characteristic curves (i.e., relative permeability and saturation functions and associated parameters) to be associated with a material property. 
**This card is currently only supported for the GENERAL, HYDRATE, RICHARDS, TH (non-ice) and WIPP_FLOW flow modes. The** :ref:`saturation-function-card` **card should be used in all other flow modes.**

SATURATION_FUNCTION <string>
  Opens a saturation function block where <string> indicates the type of saturation function to be employed.

PERMEABILITY_FUNCTION <string>
  Opens a relative permeability function block where <string> indicates the
  type of liquid or gas relative permeability function. For multiphase flow,

  phase. For single-phase variably saturated flow (e.g. RICHARDS MODE), only a liquid phase 
  relative permeability function should be specified.

  The available relative permeability functions are documented in the Theory Guide under
  :ref:`relative-permeability-functions-general`.

  :ref:`parameter-definitions`.

.. _parameter-definitions:

Parameter Definitions
---------------------
ALPHA <float>
 Inverse of the air entry pressure for saturation function [Pa\ :sup:`-1`\].

FILE <string>
 Filepath to file containing saturation-capillary pressure or saturation-relative permeability pairs. Must be in ascending order of saturation and monotonic.

KPC <integer>
 WIPP-specific flag from BRAGFLO.
 * KPC 1 ignores MAX_CAPILLARY_PRESSURE
 * KPC 2 Flat Set KPC to ``2`` to activate
 * KPC 3-5 Not used
 * KPC 6 Linear extention to MAX_CAPILLARY_PRESSURE
 * KPC 6 Exponential extention to MAX_CAPILLARY_PRESSURE

KR_MAX <float>
 Modified Brooks Corey relative permeability function maximum 
 relative permeability [-].

LAMBDA <float>
 Brooks-Corey \lambda parameter [-].

LIST
  Opens block to list saturaiton-capillary pressure or saturation-relative permeability value pairs. Must be in ascending order of saturation and monotonic.
M <float>
 Exponential parameter m in van Genuchten models. Parameter n is calculated as follows:

 * For van Genuchten capillary pressure, n=1/(1-m).
 * For van Genuchten relative permeability with Burdine equations, n = ?
 * For van Genuchten relative permeability with Mualem equations, n = ?

N <float>
 Modified Brooks Corey relative permeability exponent "n" [-].

S_MIN <float>
 This is a parameter from BRAGFLO. It is a cutoff in liquid saturation that is
 considered numerically dry, and it is smaller than liquid residual saturation.

S_EFFMIN <float>
 This is a parameter from BRAGFLO. It is the liquid saturation below S_MIN
 at which the Brooks Corey model becomes singular, or the capillary pressure
 is capped. It can also be thought of as a small tolerance which pushes the
 singularity in the capillary pressure to a liquid saturation slightly below
 S_MIN.

SMOOTH
 Applies polynomial smoothing to discontinuities in derivatives for relative 
 permeability or saturation functions.
 The smoothing operation is documented under :ref:`smoothing-operation` in
 the Theory Guide.
 Supported for the following:

  * Brooks Corey (**highly recommended if saturated cells exist**)
  * Burdine (w/ van Genuchten liquid relative permeability)
  * Mualem (w/ van Genuchten liquid relative permeability)

TOLC <float>
 A tolerance interval over which the relative permeability changes linearly
 from zero to one [-].


MODIFIED_KOSUGI model
 This model is based on a truncated lognormal pore-size
 distribution. The distribution is truncated at the higher end only
 (3-parameter version) or higher and lower ends (4-parameter version)
 of the pore-size distribution. The original Kosugi model was for a
 3-parameter moisture retention curve, but only developed a relative
 permeability function in the limit as :math:`\mathrm{R_{MAX}}
 \rightarrow \infty` and :math:`\mathrm{R}_0 \rightarrow 0` (i.e., the
 2-parameter version). PFLOTRAN implements a closed-form approximation
 to the 3-parameter relative permeability function and an extended
 4-parameter moisture retention curve and relative permeability model
 proposed by Malama & Kuhlman
 (2015). http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gwat.12220

  * SIGMAZ <float> variance of the log pore-size distribution (in m).
    Essentially, this parameter is related to the slope and location of the
    inflection in the moisture retention and relative permeability curves.

  * MUZ <float> mean of the log pore-size distribution (in m). Essentially,
    this parameter is related to the position of the moisture retention curve
    along the capillary pressure axis (i.e., similar to the air-entry pressure).

  * NPARAM <int> number of parameters in the model. Valid values are 3
    (upper-truncated pore-size distribution only) and 4 (upper- and
    lower-truncated pore-size distribution). When this is set to 3 the value
    of R0 is not used, and is not required to be set.

  * RMAX <float> maximum pore size (in m) in lognormal pore-size
    distribution.

  * R0 <float> minimum pore size (in m) in lognormal pore-size
    distribution. Only used if NPARAM=4. The user must ensure
    :math:`\mathrm{R_0}<\mathrm{R_{MAX}}`. Also, if they are too close 
    numerical problems may arise.

Optional Cards under the CHARACTERISTIC_CURVES block:
*****************************************************

DEFAULT
 Sets up dummy saturation and permeability functions for saturated single phase
 flow. If DEFAULT is specified, then the SATURATION_FUNCTION and the
 PERMEABILITY_FUNCTION blocks need not be specified.

TEST
 Including this keyword will produce output (.dat files) which provides (a) the
 capillary pressure for the entire range of liquid saturation, (b) the liquid
 saturation for the entire range of capillary pressures, and (c) the liquid and
 gas relative permeability values for the range of liquid saturation. See
 :ref:`how-to-test-CCs` for detailed instructions on how to use this keyword.


Optional Cards under the SATURATION_FUNCTION or PERMEABILITY_FUNCTION blocks:
*****************************************************************************

GAS_RESIDUAL_SATURATION <float>
 Residual saturation of gas phase [-]. Where used, default 100%.

LIQUID_JUNCTION_SATURATION <float>
 Liquid saturation for UNSATURATED_EXTENSION extrapolations [-]. Default 5% effective saturation (.05*(1-Srg-Srl)+Srl).

LIQUID_RESIDUAL_SATURATION <float>
 Residual saturation of liquid phase [-]. Default 0%.

LOOP_INVARIANT
 Caches calculated intermediate parameters, depending on compiler options, may speed performance. This is a necessary selection to utilize UNSATURATED_EXTENSIONS.

MAX_CAPILLARY_PRESSURE <float>
 Maximum capillary pressure in Pa. Default value is 10^9 Pa.
 Default behaivor truncates capillary pressure to this value near and below residual saturation.
 UNSATURATED_EXTENSIONs set this value at 0 liquid saturation and interpolate.

SPLINE <integer>
 Replace analytic model with Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolation Polynomials (PCHIP).
 This may reduce computational time for complex saturation or relative permeability functions.

UNSATURATED_EXTENSION <string>
 Define capillary pressure behaivor near and below residual saturation. Options include:

 * NONE - Asymptotically approach infinity at residual and remain undefined below residual.
 * FCPC - Truncation to MAX_CAPILLARY_PRESSURE and extrapolation to 0 saturation. Default.
 * FNOC - Truncation to value calculated at LIQUID_JUNCTION_SATURATION and extrapolation to 0 saturation.
 * LCPC - Linear interpolation from MAX_CAPILLARY_PRESSURE at 0 to calculated junction.
 * ECPC - Exponential interpolation from MAX_CAPILLARY_PRESSURE at 0 to calculated junction.
 * LNOC - Linear extrapolation from LIQUID_JUNCTION_SATURATION to 0 saturation.
 * ENOC - Exponential extrapolation from LIQUID_JUNCTION_SATURATION to 0 saturation.
