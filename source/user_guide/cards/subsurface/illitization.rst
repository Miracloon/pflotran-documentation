ILLITIZATION
=============================
This option specifies the illitization model associated with a material property. This allows for a time- and temperature-dependent change from smectite to illite to be evaluated during the simulation, which in turn can be used to impart a commensurate change in permeability, etc.

This feature is currently available for :ref:`general-card` and :ref:`th-card` modes.

Illitization Parameter Definitions
---------------------------------------------------

In the DEFAULT model (ref. 1), for a given time step :math:`i+1`, the time rate of change of smectite :math:`\left(\frac{df_{S}}{dt}\right)` into illite is based on the smectite fraction :math:`f_{S,i}` and potassium cation concentration :math:`[K^{+}]`. It is defined as follows:

:math:`\left.-\frac{df_{S}}{dt}\right|^{i+1}=\left\{{\begin{array}{cc} [K^{+}]\cdot (f_{S}^{i})^{2}\cdot A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_{a}}{\mathcal{R}T^{i+1}}\right)} & T^{i+1}\geq T_{th} \\ 0 & T^{i+1}<T_{th} \\ \end{array} } \right.` [1/s]

where :math:`A` is the frequency term, :math:`E_{a}` is the activation energy, :math:`\mathcal{R}` is the ideal gas constant, :math:`T^{i+1}` is the temperature in Kelvin, and :math:`T_{th}` is the threshold temperature. The value of :math:`[K^{+}]` is currently implemented as a constant.

The time-integrated smectite fraction is evaluated as: 

:math:`f_{S}^{i+1} = \frac{f_{S}^{i}}{1-[K^{+}]\cdot A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_{a}}{\mathcal{R}T^{i+1}}\right)}\cdot (t^{i+1}-t^{i})\cdot f_{S}^{i}}`

The illite fraction is defined as the complement of the smectite fraction:

:math:`f_{I}^{i+1} = 1 - f_{S}^{i+1}`

A scale factor :math:`F` is defined that ranges from 0 to 1 and is based on the relative change in the fraction of illite:

:math:`F= \frac{f_{I}^{i+1}-f_{I}^{0}}{f_{S}^{0}}`

The change in a given permeability component :math:`k_{j}^{i+1}` at time step :math:`i+1` as a result of illitization is computed as:

:math:`k_{j}^{i+1}=k_{j}^{0}\left(1+F\cdot C_{k}\right)`

where :math:`k_{j}^{0}` is the original permeability tensor, :math:`C_{k}` is the permeability shift factor, and :math:`f_{S}^{0}` and :math:`f_{I}^{0}` are the initial fractions of smectite and illite, respectively. This suggests that when all of the original smectite is illitized, the permeability has been enhanced by a factor of :math:`1+ C_{k}`. 

In the GENERAL model (ref. 2), the time rate of change of smectite is defined with the potassium concentration raised to exponent :math:`m` and the smectite fraction raised to exponent :math:`n`, where the temperature-dependent Arrhenius term is simplified as :math:`k(T)`:

:math:`\left.-\frac{df_{S}}{dt}\right|^{i+1}=\left\{{\begin{array}{cc} [K^{+}]^{m}\cdot (f_{S}^{i})^{n}\cdot k(T) & T^{i+1}\geq T_{th} \\ 0 & T^{i+1}<T_{th} \\ \end{array} } \right.` [1/s]

The time-integrated smectite fraction is evaluated based on the choice of :math:`n`:

:math:`f_{S}^{i+1}=\left\{{\begin{array}{cc} \left\{[K^{+}]^{m}\cdot k(T)\cdot (n-1)(t^{i+1}-t^{i})+(f_{S}^{i})^{1-n}) \right\}^{\frac{1}{1-n}} & n>1 \\ f_{S}^{i}\cdot \exp{\left\{-k(T)\cdot[K^{+}]^{m}\cdot(t^{i+1}-t^{i})\right\}} & n=1 \\ \end{array} } \right.`

SMECTITE_INITIAL <float>
 The initial fraction of smectite in the material relative to illite, :math:`f_{S}^{0}` (default of 1.0).

SMECTITE_EXP <float>
 The exponent of the smectite fraction, :math:`n`.

THRESHOLD_TEMPERATURE <float>
 The temperature in Celsius at and above which the illitization process occurs, :math:`T_{th}` (default of 0Â°C).

SHIFT_PERM <float>
 The factor applied to the net change in illite fraction that is used to modify the permeability, :math:`C_{k}` (default of 1.0).

SHIFT_KD (optional)
 For specified elements, factors are provided to modify sorption distribution coefficients, :math:`K_{d}`, based on the net change in the illite fraction. One list entry consists of the element <string>, which must be present in the :ref:`ufd-decay-card` process model, the function type, and the functional parameters <float> (see below).
   
   DEFAULT - :math:`C_{1}` <float>
   
     :math:`K_{d}^{i+1} = K_{d}^{i}(1 + F\cdot C_{1})`

EA <float>
  The activation energy in the temperature-dependent Arrhenius term, :math:`E_{a}` [J/mol].

FREQ <float>
  The frequency term, or coefficient used to scale the temperature-dependent Arrhenius term, :math:`A` [L/mol-s].

K_CONC <float>
  The initial concentration of potassium cation in the material, :math:`[K^{+}]` [M].

K_EXP <float>
  The exponent of the potassium cation concentration, :math:`m`.
