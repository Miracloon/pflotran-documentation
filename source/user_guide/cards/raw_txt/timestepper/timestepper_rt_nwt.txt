CFL_GOVERNOR
 Specifies a maximum CFL (Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy) number that governs time step size. Subsequent time steps are calculated as a function of the maximum flow velocity and grid discretization such that the CFL is not exceeded.

MAX_VOLUME_FRACTION_CHANGE <float>
 Limits the time step based on the maximum desired change in mineral volume 
 fraction. (default = 1.d0)
