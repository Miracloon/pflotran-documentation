ANALYTICAL_JACOBIAN
 Calculate derivatives in Jacobian analytically.

NUMERICAL_JACOBIAN
 Calculate derivatives in Jacobian numerically.

USE_INFINITY_NORM_CONVERGENCE
 @RICHARDS TH 
 @EXPERT
 Newton iteration will converge on infinity norm convergence criteria for both the solution update and the residual.

PRESSURE_DAMPENING_FACTOR <float>
 @TH RICHARDS
 @EXPERT
 Factor by which the pressure solution update is dampened.

PRESSURE_CHANGE_LIMIT <float>
 @TH
 @EXPERT
 The change in pressure is truncated to within this limit.

SATURATION_CHANGE_LIMIT <float>
 @RICHARDS TH 
 @EXPERT
 The change in saturation is truncated to within this limit.

TEMPERATURE_CHANGE_LIMIT <float>
 @TH 
 @EXPERT
 The change in temperature is truncated to within this limit.
