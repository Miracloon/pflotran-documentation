MAX_ITERATION_BEFORE_DAMPING <integer>
 @EXPERT
 Specifies the threshold number of Newton iterations before damping is imposed.

DAMPING_FACTOR <float>
 @EXPERT
 The scalar value by which the solution is damped between each Newton-Raphson iteration. Acceptable values on (0,1].

MAXIMUM_PRESSURE_CHANGE <float>
 @EXPERT
 The change in pressure is truncated to within this limit.
