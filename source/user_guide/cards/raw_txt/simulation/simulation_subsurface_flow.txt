COUNT_UPWIND_DIRECTION_FLIP
 Turns on and increments a counter whenever the upwind direction changes. This is only useful for non-parallel execution.

FIX_UPWIND_DIRECTION
 Limits the update of the upwind direction (based on pressure gradients) to UPWIND_DIR_UPDATE_FREQUENCY Newton iterations.

LOGGING_VERBOSITY <integer>
 Prints additional convergence logging to the screen when the integer is greater than 0 (for process models that have logging verbosity implemented).

MULTIPLE_CONTINUUM
 Turns on multi-continuum energy for the MPHASE or TH flow modes.

REPLACE_INIT_PARAMS_ON_RESTART
 Forces the overwrite of base (0) porosity and permeabilities off which solution dependent parameters may be calculated.

REVERT_PARAMETERS_ON_RESTART
 Reverts permeability and porosity back to the values specified in the input file instead of the checkpointed values.

UNFIX_UPWIND_DIRECTION
 Turns off fixing of upwind direction.

UPWIND_DIR_UPDATE_FREQUENCY
 Frequency at which the upwind direction is updated if FIX_UPWIND_DIRECTION is included.
