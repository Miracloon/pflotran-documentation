ARITHMETIC_GAS_DIFFUSIVE_DENSITY
 Use arithmetic weighting for gas diffusivity.

CHECK_MAX_DPL_LIQ_STATE_ONLY
 @EXPERT
 When calculating the maximum change in liquid pressure over a time step, consider only liquid state cells. Helpful when capillary pressures are extreme.

DIFFUSE_XMASS
 @EXPERT
 Calculate gradietns of dissolved gas in diffusion equation based on mass fraction instead of mole fraction.

GAS_COMPONENT_FORMULA_WEIGHT <float>
 Specifies the molecular weight of the gas component [g/mol].

HARMONIC_GAS_DIFFUSIVE_DENSITY
 Use harmonic weighting for gas diffusivity.

IMMISCIBLE
 Disables solubility calculations.

LIQUID_COMPONENT_FORMULA_WEIGHT <float>
 Specifies the molecular weight of the liquid component [g/mol].

NO_STATE_TRANSITION_OUTPUT
 Eliminates “State Transition” screen output. E.g. *State Transition: 2 Phase -> Gas at Cell 23331*

NO_TEMP_DEPENDENT_DIFFUSION
 Turns off temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients.

PHASE_CHANGE_EPSILON <float>
 @EXPERT
 Assign a fixed initial saturation of a new phase that is created upon a state change.

RESTRICT_STATE_CHANGE
 @EXPERT
 Restricts any changes of state to only occur once per Newton iteration.

TWO_PHASE_STATE_ENERGY_DOF <string>
 @EXPERT
 Sets the primary dependent variable for the energy conservation equation for cells in a two-phsae state (3rd dof) [TEMPERATURE, AIR_PRESSURE]. (default = TEMPERATURE, which is most tested)

WINDOW_EPSILON <float>
 @EXPERT
 Specifies the tolerance or window that must be exceeded before state change
 will occur.
