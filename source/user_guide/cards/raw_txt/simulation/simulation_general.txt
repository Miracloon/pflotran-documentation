GAS_STATE_AIR_MASS_DOF <string>
 Sets the primary dependent variable for the air mass conservation equation for cells in a single-phase gas state (2nd dof) [AIR_PRESSURE, WATER_MOL_FRAC]. (default = AIR_PRESSURE, whihc is the most tested)

ISOTHERMAL
 Disables the energy calculation forcing constant temperature.

NO_AIR
 Disables the gas component mass conservation equation.
