GAS_STATE_AIR_MASS_DOF <string>
 @EXPERT
 Sets the primary dependent variable for the air mass conservation equation for cells in a single-phase gas state (2nd dof) [AIR_PRESSURE, WATER_MOL_FRAC]. (default = AIR_PRESSURE, whihc is the most tested)

ISOTHERMAL
 Disables the energy calculation forcing constant temperature.

NO_AIR
 Disables the gas component mass conservation equation.

NEWTONTRDC_HOLD_INNER_ITERATIONS
 @EXPERT
 If your simulation expects many state changes throughout the simulation, NEWTONTRDC_HOLD_INNER_ITERATIONS is recommended.

NON_DARCY_FLOW
 Calculates non-Darcian flow based on Liu (2014)

NON_DARCY_FLOW_A
 Parameter A for non-Darcian flow in equation 11 in Liu (2014)

NON_DARCY_FLOW_B
 Parameter B for non-Darcian flow in equation 11 in Liu (2014)
