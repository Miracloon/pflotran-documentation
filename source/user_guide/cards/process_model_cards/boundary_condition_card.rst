BOUNDARY_CONDITION
==================
This card links a particular :ref:`flow-condition-card` and 
:ref:`transport-condition-card` to the appropriate :ref:`region-card` to
define a boundary condition. 
It is set up similar to the :ref:`initial-condition-card` card, 
by first creating a list of flow and/or transport conditions, and then 
appling them to appropriate REGIONs using this card.

Required Cards:
---------------
BOUNDARY_CONDITION <optional string>
 Opens the BOUNDARY_CONDITION block, labeling it with the <optional string>. The label is useful for output purposes (e.g. labeling mass flux across the boundary region in the mass balance [\*-mas.dat] file).

FLOW_CONDITION <string>
 Name of the associated :ref:`flow-condition-card`

TRANSPORT_CONDITION <string>
 Name of the associated :ref:`transport-condition-card`
  
REGION <string>
 Name of the associated :ref:`region-card`
