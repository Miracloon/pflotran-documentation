MATERIAL_TRANSFORM_GENERAL
##########################
The Material Transform Process Model is documented here.

This option specifies the material transform process model, which is a child of flow and a peer of transport. Under the :ref:`simulation-card` block, the process model is included by adding the MATERIAL_TRANSFORM block:

 ::

   SIMULATION
     SIMULATION_TYPE SUBSURFACE
     PROCESS_MODELS
       SUBSURFACE_FLOW flow
         MODE GENERAL
       /

         MODE GIRT
       /
       MATERIAL_TRANSFORM <name_string>
       /
     /
   END

where <name_string> is a user-defined name for the process model. There are currently no additional options for this block. Functionality is currently available for problems utilizing flow modes (such as :ref:`general-card`, :ref:`th-card`, and :ref:`richards-card`) and/or reactive transport with :ref:`ufd-decay-card`.

The details of the process model are included in the MATERIAL_TRANSFORM_GENERAL block, which lists several MATERIAL_TRANSFORM objects that can be associated with a :ref:`material-property-card`.

Supported models that can be included in a MATERIAL_TRANSFORM object include the following:

ILLITIZATION
============
The illitization function allows for a time- and temperature-dependent change from smectite to illite to be evaluated during the simulation, which in turn can be used to impart a commensurate change in permeability and/or sorption.

Illitization Parameter Definitions
**********************************

In the DEFAULT model (ref. 1), for a given time step :math:`i+1`, the time rate of change of smectite :math:`\left(\frac{df_{S}}{dt}\right)` into illite is based on the smectite fraction :math:`f_{S,i}` and potassium cation concentration :math:`[K^{+}]`. It is defined as follows:

:math:`\left.-\frac{df_{S}}{dt}\right|^{i+1}=\left\{{\begin{array}{cc} [K^{+}]\cdot (f_{S}^{i})^{2}\cdot A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_{a}}{\mathcal{R}T^{i+1}}\right)} & T^{i+1}\geq T_{th} \\ 0 & T^{i+1}<T_{th} \\ \end{array} } \right.` [1/s]

where :math:`A` is the frequency term, :math:`E_{a}` is the activation energy, :math:`\mathcal{R}` is the ideal gas constant, :math:`T^{i+1}` is the temperature in Kelvin, and :math:`T_{th}` is the threshold temperature. The value of :math:`[K^{+}]` is currently implemented as a constant.

The time-integrated smectite fraction is evaluated as: 

:math:`f_{S}^{i+1} = \frac{f_{S}^{i}}{1-[K^{+}]\cdot A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_{a}}{\mathcal{R}T^{i+1}}\right)}\cdot (t^{i+1}-t^{i})\cdot f_{S}^{i}}`

The illite fraction is defined as the complement of the smectite fraction:

:math:`f_{I}^{i+1} = 1 - f_{S}^{i+1}`

A scale factor :math:`F` is defined that ranges from 0 to 1 and is based on the relative change in the fraction of illite:

:math:`F^{i+1}= \frac{f_{I}^{i+1}-f_{I}^{0}}{f_{S}^{0}}`

This is used to modify the permeability and/or soprtion based on a user-specified function (see SHIFT_PERM and SHIFT_KD below). 

In the GENERAL model (ref. 2), the time rate of change of smectite is defined with the potassium concentration raised to exponent :math:`m` and the smectite fraction raised to exponent :math:`n`, where the temperature-dependent Arrhenius term is simplified as :math:`k(T)`:

:math:`\left.-\frac{df_{S}}{dt}\right|^{i+1}=\left\{{\begin{array}{cc} [K^{+}]^{m}\cdot (f_{S}^{i})^{n}\cdot k(T) & T^{i+1}\geq T_{th} \\ 0 & T^{i+1}<T_{th} \\ \end{array} } \right.` [1/s]

The frequency term :math:`A` in :math:`k(T)` must be defined in units that correspond to the choice of :math:`m` and :math:`n`. The time-integrated smectite fraction is evaluated based on the choice of :math:`n`:

:math:`f_{S}^{i+1}=\left\{{\begin{array}{cc} \left\{[K^{+}]^{m}\cdot k(T)\cdot (n-1)(t^{i+1}-t^{i})+(f_{S}^{i})^{1-n}) \right\}^{\frac{1}{1-n}} & n>1 \\ f_{S}^{i}\cdot \exp{\left\{-k(T)\cdot[K^{+}]^{m}\cdot(t^{i+1}-t^{i})\right\}} & n=1 \\ \end{array} } \right.`

SMECTITE_INITIAL <float>
 The initial fraction of smectite in the material relative to illite, :math:`f_{S}^{0}` (default of 1.0).

SMECTITE_EXP <float>
 The exponent of the smectite fraction, :math:`n`.

THRESHOLD_TEMPERATURE <float>
 The temperature in Celsius at and above which the illitization process occurs, :math:`T_{th}` (default of 0Â°C).

SHIFT_PERM <string> <float> (optional)
 Factors are provided to modify the original permeability tensor :math:`k_{j}^{0}` based on changes to the smectite/illite composition. This entry consists of the function type <string> and the functional parameters :math:`C_{k}` <float> (see below). Simulations utilizing this feature must have an active flow mode.
   
   DEFAULT/LINEAR - :math:`C_{k,1}`

     :math:`C_{k,1}` is the factor applied to the relative change in the illite fraction :math:`(F)` that is used to isotropically modify the original permeability. The change in a given permeability component :math:`k_{j}^{i+1}` at time step :math:`i+1` as a result of illitization is computed as:

     :math:`k_{j}^{i+1}=k_{j}^{0}\left(1+C_{k,1}\cdot F^{i+1} \right)`

     This suggests that when all of the original smectite is transformed to illite, the permeability has been enhanced by a factor of :math:`1+ C_{k,1}`.
   
   QUADRATIC - :math:`C_{k,1}, C_{k,2}`
   
      :math:`k_{j}^{i+1} = k_{j}^{0}\left[1 + C_{k,1}\cdot F^{i+1} + C_{k,2}\cdot (F^{i+1})^{2}\right]`
   
   POWER - :math:`C_{k,1}, C_{k,2}`
   
      :math:`k_{j}^{i+1} = k_{j}^{0}\left[1 + C_{k,1}\cdot(F^{i+1})^{C_{k,2}}\right]`
   
   EXPONENTIAL - :math:`C_{k,1}`
   
      :math:`k_{j}^{i+1} = k_{j}^{0}\exp{\left(C_{k,1}\cdot F^{i+1}\right)}`

SHIFT_KD (optional)
 For specified elements, factors are provided to modify original sorption distribution coefficients, :math:`K_{d}^{0}`, based on changes to the smectite/illite composition. In this sub-block, one list entry consists of the element :math:`e` <string>, the function type <string>, and the functional parameters :math:`C` <float> (see below). Simulations utilizing this feature must have an active transport mode and elements listed *must* be present in the :ref:`ufd-decay-card` process model.
   
   DEFAULT/LINEAR - :math:`C_{1}`
   
     :math:`K_{d,e}^{i+1} = K_{d,e}^{0}\left(1 + C_{1,e}\cdot F^{i+1}\right)`
   
   QUADRATIC - :math:`C_{1}, C_{2}`
   
     :math:`K_{d,e}^{i+1} = K_{d,e}^{0}\left[1 + C_{1,e}\cdot F^{i+1} + C_{2,e}\cdot (F^{i+1})^{2}\right]`
   
   POWER - :math:`C_{1}, C_{2}`
   
     :math:`K_{d,e}^{i+1} = K_{d,e}^{0}\left[1 + C_{1,e}\cdot(F^{i+1})^{C_{2,e}}\right]`
   
   EXPONENTIAL - :math:`C_{1}`
   
     :math:`K_{d,e}^{i+1} = K_{d,e}^{0}\exp{\left(C_{1,e}\cdot F^{i+1}\right)}`

EA <float>
  The activation energy in the temperature-dependent Arrhenius term, :math:`E_{a}` [J/mol].

FREQ <float>
  The frequency term, or coefficient used to scale the temperature-dependent Arrhenius term, :math:`A` [L/mol-s].

K_CONC <float>
  The initial concentration of potassium cation in the material, :math:`[K^{+}]` [M].

K_EXP <float>
  The exponent of the potassium cation concentration, :math:`m`.
