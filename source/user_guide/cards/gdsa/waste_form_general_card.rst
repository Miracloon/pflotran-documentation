MECHANISM <type_string>

 The mechanism block specifies a waste form mechanism. The mechanism includes the details of the radionuclide
 species, the waste form bulk material details, and the canister that contains the waste form. Several 
 different custom mechanisms can be defined, or chosen from pre-defined options. Each mechanism is given a 
 unique name, and later associated with specific listed waste forms. The following types are currently 
 supported: GLASS, DSNF, FMDM, FMDM_SURROGATE, FMDM_SURROGATE_KNNR, :ref:`WIPP<wipp_waste_form>`, and CUSTOM.

  CANISTER_DEGRADATION_MODEL sub-block (optional for all mechanism types)

   If this optional block is included, the canister degradation model will be turned on. Currently, this 
   model will keep track of canister vitality, a parameter which controls the time of waste form breach. At 
   the beginning of the simulation, vitality = 1. Waste form breach occurs when the canister vitality falls 
   to zero. The reference vitality degradation rate (Rv0) is either (a) chosen at the beginning of the 
   simulation, for each waste form, based on a normal distribution of degradation rates, (b) specified for 
   each waste form by the user, or (c) ignored if the user specifies a canister breach time for each waste 
   form instead of a rate. The effective vitality degradation rate (Rv) is calculated as an Arrhenius 
   function of temperature, canister material constant (C), and the reference vitality degradation rate: 

   log10(Rv) = log10(Rv0) + C * (1/333.15[K] - 1/T[K])

   If option "a" is desired, the normal distribution for the reference rate is formed by providing the 
   following block keywords (all required):

    VITALITY_LOG10_MEAN

     Specifies the Log(base10) mean vitality degradation rate (in units of log10-1/yr). If this distribution 
     parameter is omitted, then CANISTER_VITALITY_RATE must be included for all waste forms associated with 
     this mechanism.

    VITALITY_LOG10_STDEV

     Specifies the Log(base10) standard deviation of the vitality degradation rate (in units of log10-1/yr). 
     If this distribution parameter is omitted, then CANISTER_VITALITY_RATE must be included for all waste 
     forms associated with this mechanism.

    VITALITY_UPPER_TRUNCATION

     Specifies the Log(base10) upper truncation of the mean vitality degradation rate (in units of 
     log10-1/yr). If this distribution parameter is omitted, then CANISTER_VITALITY_RATE must be included for 
     all waste forms associated with this mechanism.

    CANISTER_MATERIAL_CONSTANT

     Specifies the canister material constant (ex: 1500 for 316L stainless steel).

WASTE_FORM sub-block

 Specifies the details of each waste form. This block should be repeated for each waste form, and can include 
 the following cards:

  COORDINATE <double> <double> <double> -or- REGION <string>

   If COORDINATE, <double> <double> <double> gives the location of each waste form in x, y, z. Waste forms can
   be co-located (i.e., there can be multiple waste forms located at the same coordinate point. If REGION, 
   <string> gives the name of a defined region that the waste form occupies. The source term will be released
   over the cells of the REGION, or the single cell of the COORDINATE. Note that REGION and COORDINATE can't
   be given, only one is allowed.

  EXPOSURE_FACTOR <double> (optional)

   Gives the exposure factor of each waste form, which is a multiplier to the waste form dissolution rate. If 
   this keyword is not specified, the default value is 1.

  VOLUME <double> <unit_string>

   Gives the volume of each waste form.

  MECHANISM_NAME <string>

   Specifies the name of the mechanism associated with the waste form. The mechanism name given here must 
   match one of the mechanisms defined in the MECHANISM sub-block(s).

  CANISTER_VITALITY_RATE <double> <unit_string> (optional)

   Specifies the waste form canister's vitality degradation rate in units of 1/time. If this parameter is 
   specified, the mechanism associated to this waste form must include the CANISTER_DEGRADATION_BLOCK, but 
   *without* the distribution parameters (e.g. VITALITY_LOG10_MEAN, VITALITY_LOG10_STDEV, and  
   VITALITY_UPPER_TRUNCATION). This option cannot be combined with CANISTER_BREACH_TIME for a single waste 
   form, but both CANISTER_BREACH_TIME and CANISTER_VITALITY_RATE can be combined for different waste forms 
   under the same mechanism which omits the distribution parameters.

  CANISTER_BREACH_TIME <double> <unit_string> (optional)

   Specifies the waste form canister's breach time in units of time. The canister will breach during the next 
   timestep where time > CANISTER_BREACH_TIME. If this parameter is specified, the mechanism associated to 
   this waste form must include the CANISTER_DEGRADATION_BLOCK, but *without* the distribution parameters 
   (e.g. VITALITY_LOG10_MEAN, VITALITY_LOG10_STDEV, and VITALITY_UPPER_TRUNCATION). This option cannot be 
   combined with CANISTER_VITALITY_RATE for a single waste form, but both CANISTER_BREACH_TIME and 
   CANISTER_VITALITY_RATE can be combined for different waste forms under the same mechanism which omits the 
   distribution parameters.
  
  DECAY_START_TIME <double> <unit_string> (optional)
  
   Specifies the time that the waste within the waste form will begin to decay.
   If this card is not specified, the default decay start time is 0 seconds
   (e.g. at the first time step of the simulation). This card is useful if you
   have an inventory that is specific to a certain time in the simulation, and
   you don't want to back-calculate what the inventory should have been at
   the beginning of the simulation.

  CRITICALITY_MECHANISM_NAME <string> (optional)
   
   Specifies the name of the associated criticality mechanism defining the criticality event in the waste form. The criticality mechanism name given here must match one of the mechanisms defined in the CRITICALITY_MECH sub-block(s).
   
  SPACER_MECHANISM_NAME <string> (optional)
   
   Specifies the name of the associated spacer grid degradation mechanism in the waste form. The spacer grid degradation mechanism name given here must match one of the mechanisms defined in the SPACER_DEGRADATION_MECHANISM sub-block(s).

Optional Cards: 
---------------

PRINT_MASS_BALANCE

 If this option is included, output will be generated at each timestep that the waste form process model is 
 called. The output includes the cumulative mass and instantaneous mass rate for each species in each waste 
 form, the volume, dissolution rate, and the canister vitality of each waste form.
 
IMPLICIT_SOLUTION

 Including this card will solve the decay and ingrowth of the radionuclide
 inventory within the waste form using an implicit approach based on solving
 the Bateman equation using Newton's method. This option should be used if the
 3-generation analytical solution is not appropriate.
 
SPACER_DEGRADATION_MECHANISM
 
 If this optional block is included, a time- and temperature-dependent spacer grid corrosion model will be evaluated as a means of terminating criticality events associated with the waste form. The model becomes active after the canister is breached. When the spacer grids have degraded below 1% of the original total mass, they are assumed to fail, which implies a loss of critical configuration.
 
 The spacer grid vitality :math:`V_{s}` is determined using the corrosion rate :math:`R` and total initial mass :math:`M_{0}` over time steps :math:`t_{i}` to :math:`t_{i+1}`, where at canister breach :math:`V_{s,0}=1`:
 
 :math:`V_{s,i+1}=V_{s,i}-\frac{R_{i+1}\cdot(t_{i+1}-t_{i})}{M_{0}}`
 
 The corrosion rate is governed by an Arrhenius term using the average temperature of the waste form :math:`\bar{T}`, the total spacer grid surface area :math:`A_{0}`, and a saturation-dependent term :math:`f_{S}(S_{l})`, where :math:`\mathcal{R}` is the ideal gas constant:
 
 :math:`R_{i+1}=f_{S}(S_{l,i+1})\cdot A_{0}\cdot\mathcal{C}\exp{\left(-\frac{Q}{\mathcal{R}\bar{T}_{i+1}}\right)}`
 
 The saturation-dependent term modifies the corrosion rate depending on an exposure level :math:`S_{l}^{exp}`, which is the saturation for which the spacer grids are considered fully-inundated with water. When the saturation of the waste form is at or above this limit, the corrosion rate is unaffected. Otherwise, the rate is reduced proportionally based on the saturation.  
 
 :math:`f_{S}(S_{l})=\left\{{\begin{array}{cc}
 \frac{S_{l}}{S_{l}^{exp}} & S_{l}<S_{l}^{exp} \\
 1 & S_{l}\geq S_{l}^{exp} \\
 \end{array} }\right.`
 
 NAME <name_string>
 
  Specifies a unique name for the spacer grid degradation model.
 
 MASS <double> <unit_string>

  Total mass of spacer grids, :math:`M_{0}` [kg].

 SURFACE_AREA <double> <unit_string>

  Total surface area of spacer grids, :math:`A_{0}\,[m^{2}]` .

 EXPOSURE_LEVEL <double> (optional)

  Threshold saturation :math:`S_{l}^{exp}` for spacer grids to be considered fully-inundated with water. Saturation-dependence can be turned off by setting :math:`S_{l}^{exp}=0` or by not including this entry. 

 C <double> <unit_string>

  Empirical coefficient of the Arrhenius term governing corrosion, :math:`\mathcal{C}\,\,\left[\frac{kg}{m^{2}s}\right]`.

 Q <double> <unit_string>

  Activation energy operating on the reciprocal of temperature within the Arrhenius term governing corrosion, :math:`Q` [J/mol]. 

.. _waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism:

CRITICALITY_MECH
 
 Including this card will define a criticality mechanism that can specified for a waste form containing fissile material.
 
 NAME <name_string>
  
  Specifies a unique name for the criticality mechanism.

.. _waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism-start:

 CRIT_START <double> <unit_string>

  The start time of the criticality event.

.. _waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism-end:

 CRIT_END <double> <unit_string>

  The end time of the criticality event.

 CRITICAL_WATER_SATURATION <double>
  
  This is the liquid saturation below which the criticality event cannot be sustained. There is no heat emission from criticality until the waste form saturation is at or above this level. This is meant to be used for canisters in unsaturated systems and is not a permanent criticality termination mechanism.
 
 CRITICAL_WATER_DENSITY <double> <unit_string>
  
  This the liquid density below which the criticality event cannot be sustained. There is no heat emission from criticality until the waste form liquid density is at or above this level. This is meant to be used for canisters in saturated systems where moderator voiding is a key reactivity feedback mechanism, and it is not a permanent criticality termination mechanism.

.. _waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism-heat:
 
 HEAT_OF_CRITICALITY
  
  This sub-block defines the heat source term from criticality either as a constant (CONSTANT_POWER) or as a value that can obtained from a temperature-based lookup table (DATASET). The average temperature of the waste form and CRIT_START are used for interpolation of the lookup table to provide the power output from the waste form for the duration of the criticality event.
  
  CONSTANT_POWER <double> <unit_string>
  
  DATASET <file_string>
  
    Please refer to the example "crit_heat.txt" provided for the regression test "glass_general.in" for formatting. The data file specified by <file_string> contains the following input segments:
    
    NUM_START_TIMES <integer>
      
      The number of criticality start times provided in START_TIME (see below).
    
    NUM_VALUES_PER_START_TIME <integer>
    
      The number of data values per given criticality start time.
    
    TIME_UNITS <unit_string> (optional)
    
      The units of time provided for the START_TIME values (see below).
    
    POWER_UNITS <unit_string> (optional)
    
      The units of power provided for the POWER values (see below).
    
    START_TIME <list double>
    
      The start times of the criticality events relative to the beginning of the PFLOTRAN simulation. This affects the power output as the quantity of fissile nuclides, precursors, and neutron absorbers forming the source term for sustained chain reactions are affected by the decay period.
    
    TEMPERATURE <list double>
    
      The average waste form temperatures determining power output for a given start time. The temperature affects the power output via reactivity feedback from Doppler broadening, thermal expansion, and moderator voiding. Such phenomena are factored into the original neutronics calculations forming the basis of this surrogate model.
    
    POWER <list double>
    
      The waste form power output from the criticality event per given average temperature and start time.
  
 DECAY_HEAT <type_string>
  
  This sub-block defines the heat source term from radioactive decay, which is obtained from a time-dependent lookup table. The types of decay heat treatment include TOTAL, ADDITIONAL, and CYCLIC. By default, when a criticality event is active, the criticality source term is assumed to account for decay heat and this data is ignored.
  
  DATASET <file_string>

.. _waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism-inventory:

 INVENTORY
  
  This sub-block defines the fractional (g/g) nuclide inventory during criticality, which is obtained from a time-dependent lookup table and overrides the implicit calculation with the Bateman equations. The number of data entries in this table must equal the number of species specified in the waste form process model.
  
  DATASET <file_string>
  
    This option allows for the specification of simple lookup table specified by <file_string> where each row has the time of evaluation followed by mass fractions for each nuclide in the waste form listed in the order provided within SPECIES in MECHANISM. The table is linearly interpolated during the simulation and is assumed to correspond to the criticality conditions implied in the CRITICALITY_MECHANISM sub-block. The data table is preceded by the following keywords in the file:

    TIME_UNITS <unit_string> (optional)

      The units of time.

    DATA_UNITS <unit_string> (optional)
    
      The units for the nuclide inventory.

.. _waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism-inventory-expanded:

  EXPANDED_DATASET <file_string>

    This option allows for the specification of an expanded inventory lookup table that can be interpolated in three dimensions for a given criticality start time (:ref:`CRIT_START<waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism-start>`), criticality power output (:ref:`HEAT_OF_CRITICALITY<waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism-heat>`), and a given time during the simulation. These values are used to interpolate a data matrix where the start time and power are pivot variables and the simulation time is the independent variable. The data file specified by <file_string> contains the following input segments:

    MODE <string> (optional)

      POLYNOMIAL (default)
       The lookup table will be interpolated with Lagrange polynomials.

      LINEAR
        The lookup table will be interpolated using the trilinear method.

    TOTAL_POINTS <integer> (optional)

      The total number of inventory evaluation times in the REAL_TIME list. This keyword must be used if the real time arrays for each dataset are of different lengths and cannot be described completely by NUM_REAL_TIMES.

    NUM_START_TIMES <integer> (optional)

      The number of criticality start times expected in the START_TIME list.

    NUM_POWERS <integer> (optional)

      The number of powers expected in the POWER list.

    NUM_REAL_TIMES <integer>

      The maximum length of an individual real time array provided in the REAL_TIME list. This can be used without TOTAL_POINTS if the real time arrays for each dataset are the same length.

    NUM_SPECIES <integer> (optional)

      The number of INVENTORY blocks expected in the file. This must match the number of :ref:`SPECIES<waste-form-general-mechanism-species>` listed in the :ref:`MECHANISM<waste-form-general-mechanism>` of the waste form using this lookup table.

    TIME_UNITS <unit_string> (optional)

      The units of time for the values in START_TIME and REAL_TIME.

    POWER_UNITS <unit_string> (optional)

      The units of power for the values in POWERS.

    DATA_UNITS <unit_string> (optional)

      The units of inventory for the values in each INVENTORY block.

    START_TIME <list double>

      The start times of the criticality events relative to the beginning of the PFLOTRAN simulation. This is the first pivot variable used to construct the data matrix.

    POWER <list double>

      The power outputs of the criticality events. This is the second pivot variable used to construct the data matrix so the list is not duplicated per START_TIME. Per combination of START_TIME and POWER, there must be a dataset (i.e. no sparse data matrix).

    REAL_TIME <list double>

      The arrays of evaluation times for the radionuclide inventory. These values serve as the independent variables for the data matrix and the arrays have a multiplicity based on START_TIME and POWER. If TOTAL_POINTS is specified, the times must increase monotonically as a means of separating arrays.

    INVENTORY <list double>

      For each radionuclide in the waste form using this lookup table, an INVENTORY block provides the mass fractions per given value in the REAL_TIME list. The INVENTORY blocks must follow the order and total number of :ref:`SPECIES<waste-form-general-mechanism-species>` in the waste form :ref:`MECHANISM<waste-form-general-mechanism>`.
      
  OPTION (optional)

    This sub-block allows for the specification of options for the INVENTORY block.
    
    USE_LOOKUP_AND_IMPLICIT (optional)

      If :ref:`EXPANDED_DATASET<waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism-inventory-expanded>` is being used, this option allows for the PFLOTRAN implicit solution to be employed (i.e., radionuclide decay with no external sources) if the simulation time exceeds the maximum REAL_TIME in the relevant portion of the lookup table.

    USE_LOOKUP_AND_EXTRAPOLATION (optional)

      If :ref:`EXPANDED_DATASET<waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism-inventory-expanded>` is being used, this option allows for the interpolation subroutine to also be used for extrapolation when the simulation time exceeds the maximum REAL_TIME in the relevant portion of the lookup table.

    USE_LOOKUP_AFTER_CRITICALITY (optional)

      If :ref:`EXPANDED_DATASET<waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism-inventory-expanded>` is being used, this option allows for the lookup table to continue defining radionuclide inventories after the criticality event has ended (see :ref:`CRIT_END<waste-form-general-criticality-mechanism-end>`). Otherwise, the implicit solution (decay-only) is employed when time exceeds CRIT_END.
