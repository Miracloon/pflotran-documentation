SIMULATION Options 
------------------
*(under SUBSURFACE_GEOPHYSICS in SIMULATION PROCESS_MODELS block)*

**Basic Settings**

ARCHIE_CEMENTATION_EXPONENT
 Archie's cementation exponent $\unitless$

ARCHIE_SATURATION_EXPONENT
 Archie's saturation exponent $\unitless$

ARCHIE_TORTUOSITY_EXPONENT
 Archie's tortuosity exponent $\unitless$

CALC_MAX_TRACER_CONCENTRATION
 Causes the maximum tracer concentration (for normalization of solute concentration tracer conductivity calculation) to be calculated based on the initial concentrations specified in the initial and boundary condition and source/sinks.

CLAY_VOLUME_FACTOR
 Clay voluem factor for Waxman-Smits $\unitless$

COMPUTE_JACOBIAN
 Toggles on the calculation of the ERT Jacobian (derivatives of ERT measurements with respectd to bulk electrical conductivity).

CONDUCTIVITY_MAPPING_LAW
 Approach to calculating bulk electrical conductivity. Options: ARCHIE, WAXMAN_SMITS

MAX_TRACER_CONCENTRATION
 Specify maximum tracer concentration for normalization of solute concentration tracer conductivity calculation.

MOBILITY_DATABASE
 Database storing the mobilities $\units{\strarea\,\strelecpotential\inv\,\strinvtime}$ for aqueous species for the species conductivity calculation.

NO_ANALYTICAL POTENTIAL
 An analytical potential is calculated as the initial guess for the iterative linear solve. This flag turns the calculation off.

OUTPUT_ALL_SURVEYS
 Flag that turns on output at all surveys times.

SURFACE_ELECTRICAL_CONDUCTIVITY
 Surface electrical conductivity contribution to bulk electrical conductivity $\units{\streleccond}$

SURVEY_TIMES
 A list of times when the ERT surveys will be measured.

TRACER_CONDUCTIVITY
 Tracer electrical conductivity contribution to bulk electrical conductivity $\units{\streleccond}$

WATER_CONDUCTIVITY
 Water electrical conductivity contribution to bulk electrical conductivity $\units{\streleccond}$

WAXMAN_SMITS_CLAY_CONDUCTIVITY
 Clay electrical conductivity used in Waxman-Smiths equations $\units{\streleccond}$
