Review and Approval for Software Releases
-----------------------------------------
PFLOTRAN documentation, source code, and tests are released 
periodically under a single version number as specified by the 
PFLOTRAN Configuration Management Plan.  Senior Developers ensure 
adherence to the configuration management plan and consistency 
among the three (documentation, source, tests).  Users are notified 
of the release through the user mailing list and an updated version 
number in the online documentation.  Users obtain the latest 
released software by clone the main online repository and checking 
out the maintenance branch aligned with the release version number 
(provided in the installation instructions within the PFLOTRAN User 
Guide).
