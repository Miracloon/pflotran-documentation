Changes in PFLOTRAN 5.0
-----------------------
The following has changed in PFLOTRAN 5.0:

 * PETSc release updated to 3.20.

 * Documentation of HYDRATE flow process model was added.

 * GENERAL flow mode now supports tightly coupled salinity.

 * A geophysics electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) process model was added.
   Coupling to flow and transport within an inversion framework is under
   development.

 * Defining a REGION through a LIST of cell IDs is now supported.

 * Layered STRATA can now be defined using multiple 2D gridded datasets.

 * MEMBRANE_FILTER was added as a type of transport condition where water can
   pass through the boundary but solutes cannot.

 * Numerous reaction sandboxes have been added (calcite, chromium reduction,
   equilibration, lambda).

 * The SECONDARY_CONTINUUM card has been documented for MULTIPLE_CONTINUUM runs.

 * The PFLOTRAN Fortran coding standards were updated.

 * GDSA (Geologic Disposal Safety Assessment) capability is now documented.

 * THe GDSA material transform process model was added.

 * The PERM_HORIZONTAL card was added to define permeability in XY combined
   with a VERTICAL_ANISOTROPY_RATIO card for Z.

 * CALCULATE_INITIAL_POROSITY now causes the initial porosity to be calculated
   from 1 minus the sum of the initial mineral volume fractions.

 * The TENSORIAL_REL_PERM_EXPONENT card was added to support tensorial relative
   permeability.

 * The FLOW_CONDITION and TRANSPORT_CONDITION blocks in input decks are no
   longer ignored if the flow and transport process model is not defined, 
   respectively.
