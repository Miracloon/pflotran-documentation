Windows Installation Instructions with Visual Studio
====================================================
Author: Glenn Hammond and Heeho Park
-----------------------------------------
Note that I have been working with PETSc within the Windows environment since 
2000.  At first, setting up and programming a PETSc-based code in Windows is not 
trivial.  Relax, ask questions, and it will come to you.

Thanks to the following for input over the years:

* Satish Balay
* Luis Manuel

Required Third-Party Libraries
------------------------------
* Cygwin_: a collection of tools which provide a Linux look and feel environment for Windows.
* Git_: Software version control for PFLOTRAN and PETSc_
* PETSc_
* HDF5_: for binary I/O

Installation Instructions 
-------------------------
**Installation will take at least one full work day or more to complete.**

1. **Install Cygwin** - You can download and install the 32-bit version of 
   Windows `here <http://cygwin.com/install.html>`_

 * Choose a Download Source Dialog -> Install from Internet
 * Select Root Install Directory Dialog: -> C:\\software\\cygwin and install 
   for "All Users".

  * Strictly choose this directory as the rest of instructions follow this 
    directory structure.

 * Select Local Package Directory: -> C:\\Temp.
 * Select Your Internet Connection: -> Direct Connection
 * Choose A Download Site: -> ftp://mirror.mcs.anl.gov has always worked well, 
   but you may desire a closer site.
 * Select Packages:-> Ensure that at least the following are selected (we may 
   have to iterate on this as I do not have a clean install of which to work 
   in providing guidance).

  * All default packages (some of the below may be default)
  * bash (default) (for bash users)
  * diffutils
  * gcc
  * g++
  * git
  * gzip (default)
  * make
  * patch and patchutils
  * python
  * tar (default)
  * tcsh (for t-shell users)

 * Click the refresh arrows next to Devel and set it to install for each of 
   them.

 * Create Icons: Be sure to uncheck the annoying icons at the end.
 * **After installed, start cygwin with *Cygwin.bat* and rename the cygwin** 
   **linker as it will conflict with PETSc: "mv /usr/bin/link.exe /usr/bin/link-cygwin.exe".**  
   **This must be repeated any time cygwin is updated.**

   
2. **Install C/C++ and Fortran compilers**.

 * **Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 and Intel Fortran.** I suggest installing 
   everything in its default location.  The hints that I provide below will 
   assume this.

  * Download and install â€¢  Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2013 (VS13) and 
    Intel Parallel Studio XE (XE13) for Windows

   * For Intel, please choose 2013 SP1 Update 2
   * any versions from 2012 and on should be okay for both products
   * This takes about two hours or more depending on your internet connection 
     speed and your computer

  * Setup Cygwin tcsh shell. A *Cygwin.bat* should exist in the C:\\software\\cygwin 
    directory. Copy and paste this file and rename it to *cygwin-tcsh.bat*
  * Open the *cygwin-tcsh.bat* with your text editor and replace it with the 
    code below.

   ::

    @ echo off
    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86
    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE\bin\ifortvars.bat" ia32
    C:\software\cygwin\bin\tcsh.exe -l

  * Make sure the paths are correct and the files do exist.

3. **Install HDF5.** 

 * Go to: HDF5 Group `website <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html>`_
 * Download: *Windows (32-bit) Compilers: CMake VS 2010 C, C++, IVF 12, RWDI*
 * When you install, make sure the path is added for all users and set 
   to *C:\\Program Files (x86)\\HDF5\\1.8.12*

  * If you receive "Cannot set Path. Path is too long" message, Click on 
    Start -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment 
    Variables -> In "System Variables" box find "Path" -> Edit... -> Copy and 
    paste the path to a text editor temporarily -> replace the path with a 
    semicolon -> hit Okay -> re-install HDF5 -> Reload Path variables including 
    the HDF5 path

4. **Install PETSc.** (Please follow carefully from here)
 
 * To make sure that you have installed Intel XE compilers correctly:
  
  * Right click on cygwin-tcsh.bat file and click "Run as Administrator" (always 
    do this when opening this file)
  * On command line type:

   ::

    cl foo.c

  * You should receive C/C++ compiler version and error saying that the file 
    does not exist. This means that your C/C++ compiler has been installed 
    correctly.
  * Again On command line type:

   ::

    ifort foo.f

  * You should receive Fortran compiler version and error saying that the file 
    does not exist. This means that your C/C++ compiler has been installed 
    correctly.
    
    ..image:: ../figs/installedXE.png
    
  * Go to C:\\software on the command prompt
  * Type:

   ::

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc petsc
    cd petsc
    git checkout 8c7fbf4f8491a74970a1205819563feba7a8e746

   Obtain XXX from Step 3 on the :ref:`linux-install` page.

  **NOTE:** PFLOTRAN currently uses a snapshot of PETSc 'maint' (release) 
  branch. The only supported snapshot/version is specified by the changeset-id 
  above. The supported version will change periodically as we need bug fixes or 
  new features and changes will be announced on the mailing lists. The 
  **supported version** of petsc is used on the buildbot automated testing 
  system.

  * If this prompt times out, go to https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc online

   * Make a bitbucket account
   * Follow instructions on how to setup SSH account public and private keys 
     for git:

    * https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git

   * After the setup try the git command again and pull the repository

    * If this does not work, go download the static version of 
      `PETSc <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/petsc/download/index.html>`_

 * Install MPICH2

  * http://www.mpich.org/downloads/
  * Unofficial Binary Packages:
  * Click and Install Windows x86 (32-bit) version

 * In PETSc-git directory, select and option *configure*. Replace with the 
   following commands:

  ::

   #!/bin/csh
   setenv PETSC_DIR `pwd`
   ./config/configure.py --with-cc='win32fe cl' --with-fc='win32fe ifort' --with-cxx='win32fe cl' --with-mpi-dir=/cygdrive/C/Progra~2/MPICH2 --with-blas-lapack-dir=/cygdrive/c/Progra~2/Intel/Compos~3/mkl/lib/ia32 --with-clanguage=c --CFLAGS='-D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE -MTd' --FFLAGS='-MTd' --CXXFLAGS='-MTd' --with-debugging=yes --with-numdiff=0 --with-valgrind=0 --ignore-cygwin-link --with-c2html=0 --download-sowing=1 \
   --with-hdf5=1 \
   --with-hdf5-lib=/cygdrive/C/Progra~2/HDF5/1.8.12/lib/hdf5.lib \
   --with-hdf5-include=\[/cygdrive/C/Progra~2/HDF5/1.8.12,/cygdrive/C/Progra~2/HDF5/1.8.12/include\]

  * Make sure the *hdf.lib* file exists under that path and check to make sure 
    all the paths exist.

   * Progra~2 is the shortname notation of Program Files (x86)

 * Set the environment variables PETSC_ARCH and PETSC_DIR:

  .. image:: ../figs/envvar1.png
  .. image:: ../figs/envvar2.png

 * In the command prompt, execute *configure*
 
  * Then follow instructions on the command prompt to finish compilation

    it's okay if the second statement (test) doesn't work

    ::

      make PETSC_DIR=c/cygdrive/c/software/petsc-git PETSC_ARCH=arch-mswin-c-debug all
      make PETSC_DIR=c/cygdrive/c/software/petsc-git PETSC_ARCH=arch-mswin-c-debug test

    
6. Clone in pflotran
   
   * In the command prompt, go to C:\software and clone in pflotran using 
     Git
    
    ::

     git clone https://bitbucket.org/pflotran/pflotran

   * If htmls doesn't work, set up SSH for Git (you may have done this 
     already above):

    * https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git
    * then try: 

    ::

     git clone ssh://git@bitbucket.org/pflotran/pflotran

7. Create Visual Studio 2013 project called 'pflotran' with Intel Fortran (empty 
   project).

   * Add the PFLOTRAN source files list in the pflotran/src/pflotran/makefile to 
     source folder of the project
   * Set a boat load of settings under Project -> pflotran Properties. I list my 
     settings as displayed through the Command Line entry under Fortran and 
     Linker. You must figure out how these are set within the dialogs. Make sure 
     all the paths are set correctly and all the files exist.
   * Based upon a default installation of Visual Studio 2013 and Intel Fortran 
     Composer 15, the following property changes would have to be made (but make 
     sure to track in the Command Line entry):
     
      * Fortran Tab:
         * Preprocessor    | Preprocess source files       | Yes
         * General         | Additional included libraries | <add from example screenshot>
         * General         | Preprocessor definitions      | <add from example screenshot>
         * Code generation | Enable recursive routines     | Yes
         * General         | Compile time diagnostics      | Disable all
         * Run-time        | Check stack frame             | No
         * Libraries       | Runtime library               | Debug multithreaded
         * Additional options: /check:noarg_temp_created      


      * Linker Tab:
         * General       | Additional library directories | <add from example screenshot>
         * Input         | Ignore all default libraries   | No
         * Input         | Ignore specific libraries      | <add from example screenshot>
         * Manifest file | Generate manifest              | No
         * Input         | Additional dependencies        | <add from example screenshot>
